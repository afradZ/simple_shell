simple_shell


 The Simple Shell project is a basic command-line interpreter for Unix-like systems, implemented in C.

 It replicates the functionality of a traditional shell, enabling users to execute commands, navigate directories, and manage processes.

 Key features include executing built-in commands, handling command-line arguments, and managing the environment.

 The project is a hands-on approach to understanding how shells interact with the kernel, utilizing system calls like fork, execve, and wait.

 It's an essential project for grasping core operating system concepts.
